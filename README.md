The Core file contains the code written in the STM32CubeIDE. The files serve as an example for future games.
Each of the .c files interfaces with a peripheral of some kind, either LEDs, a analog joystick, or an I2C device.
The main.c file is where the game is written. The current game is a simplified version of Battleship.
To use the files, upload them to the CubeIDE as part of the project's "src" directory.

# Game-Boi
An embedded entertainment system 
The Core file contains the code written in the STM32CubeIDE. The files serve as an example for future games.
Each of the .c files interfaces with a peripheral of some kind, either LEDs, a analog joystick, or an I2C device.
The main.c file is where the game is written. The current game is a simplified version of Battleship.
